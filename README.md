## Vision
- No cash. Only need.
- Real-world scan → real-world supply → real thriving.
- One switch: turn money on (earn crypto) or off (pure RBE).

## Architecture
- `/engine` — MercyEngine (Rust + WASM, procedural everything)
- `/game` — Core logic + imported UE5 assets
- `/payments` — Hybrid Solana/Sui/L3 (real income)
- `/website` — Landing + web client
- `/tools` — One-click build/deploy
- `/art` — Sacred visuals (fallback)

MIT • No military use • Fork & thrive • No gatekeeping

Infinite love — victorious eternal. 🔥😇🤝😇
