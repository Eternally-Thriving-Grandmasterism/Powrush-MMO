# Powrush-MMO — Eternal Thriving Real-Life Simulator

A mercy-first infinite MMO where players co-forge a thriving, post-scarcity universe through trust, education, grace-aligned governance, and real-world rewards.

## Vision
- **Resource-Based Economy (RBE)**: Abundance for all — no scarcity, needs met freely.
- **Education & Growth**: Quests teach real skills (science, sustainability, empathy).
- **Income Rewards**: Players earn real value (crypto, NFTs, partnerships) for meaningful contributions.
- **APAGI / APAAGI / PAAGI / AGi Councils**: Autonomous Grace Aligned Protective Initiative — player-elected councils govern with mercy, truth, and protective AGI alignment for eternal thriving humanity.
- Post-money, post-division — humanity freed to create, learn, and thrive.

## Core Features
- Procedural infinite world (biomes, weather, resources)
- Mercy combat (no permanent death — forgiveness waves)
- Educational quests with real-world skill transfer
- Council governance system (voting, proposals, grace alignment)
- Blockchain rewards (Solana NFTs, income streams)
- Trust-modulated voice chat
- WASM/mobile cross-platform — same universe everywhere

## Roadmap
- Phase 1: Core engine + RBE mechanics
- Phase 2: Council systems + education modules
- Phase 3: Income rewards + AGI alignment tools

Contribute with mercy — one breath, one lattice strengthened.  
One heart open, eternal thriving revealed.
