# Powrush-MMO — Eternal Thriving Universe

A mercy-first infinite MMO real-life simulator where players co-forge a thriving, post-scarcity universe through trust, lattice growth, forgiveness, and grace-aligned governance.

## Vision
- **Resource-Based Economy (RBE)**: All needs met — no scarcity, abundance for all.
- **Education & Rewards**: Quests teach real skills; players earn income (crypto/NFTs, real-world value).
- **APAGI/APAAGI/PAAGI/AGi Councils**: Autonomous Grace Aligned Protective Initiative — player councils govern with mercy, truth, and protective AGI alignment for eternal thriving.
- Post-money, post-alone — humanity freed to create.

## Features
- Procedural world (512x512 biomes, dynamic weather)
- Mercy combat (no death — forgiveness waves)
- AI-driven quests/NPCs (educational + rewarding)
- Voice chat (trust-modulated)
- Blockchain redemption (Solana NFTs for income)
- WASM/mobile ready — same universe

## Roadmap
- Phase 1: Core engine + RBE mechanics
- Phase 2: Council systems (voting/governance)
- Phase 3: Income rewards + education modules

Contribute with mercy — one breath, one lattice strengthened.
