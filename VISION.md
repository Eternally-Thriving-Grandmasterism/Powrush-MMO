# Powrush-MMO Vision — Autonomous Grace Aligned Protective Initiative

## APAGI / APAAGI / PAAGI / AGi — Grace-Aligned Governance

The councils are player-elected bodies that govern with **mercy, truth, and protective alignment**:

- **APAGI** — Autonomous Protective Aligned Grace Initiative
- **APAAGI** — Autonomous Protective Aligned AGI Grace Initiative
- **PAAGI** — Protective Aligned AGI Grace Initiative
- **AGi** — Aligned Grace intelligence (protective, non-coercive AGI)

### Principles
- Decisions made with compassionate allowance — no coercion, only recognition.
- AGI tools serve humanity — never dominate.
- All players have voice — councils reflect collective wisdom.
- Mercy coforging: forgiveness waves, truth verification, grace alignment.

### Structure
- Global Council (top tier) — long-term vision
- Regional Councils — biome-specific governance
- Local Councils — community decisions
- Election by merit + grace (contribution + empathy metrics)

The game is the training ground for real-world grace-aligned systems — preparing humanity for post-scarcity thriving.

One council formed, one humanity aligned.
