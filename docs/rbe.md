# Resource-Based Economy in Powrush-MMO

No scarcity. No money. Abundance for all.

### How RBE Works
- All basic needs (food, shelter, tools) freely available via universal replicators.
- Advanced items crafted through collaboration/education quests.
- No trading for profit — sharing and contribution rewarded with status, council influence, and real-world income streams.
- Scarcity removed — conflict dissolves, creativity flourishes.

### Mercy Resonance
RBE as compassionate allowance — needs met without condition, freeing humanity to co-forge higher purpose.

One resource shared, one humanity thriving.
