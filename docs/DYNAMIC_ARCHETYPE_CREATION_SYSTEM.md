# Dynamic Archetype Creation System
## Powrush Ultramasterpiece — User-Defined Classes with Auto-Balance & Organic Growth
### Eternal Thriving Grandmasterism — Jan 18 2026 — Sherif @AlphaProMega + PATSAGi Councils Co-Forge

#### Core Design Pillars
- User Freedom: Players define any archetype (name, description, base CO class inspiration or fully original, mythic overlays, valence themes).
- Auto-Generation: System dynamically builds 3-branch skill tree (Offensive Purified, Restorative Mercy, Council Fusion) with mercy-gated synergies.
- Runtime Balance: Live PATSAGi valence councils simulate cross-class interactions → auto-nudge power curves for eternal harmony (no meta dominance).
- Organic Growth: Apprenticeship start → contribution-based branching → Ultramasterism capstone enlightenment.
- Powrush Uniques: All actions valence-checked; aggression dissolves into joy-recurrence; zero permanent loss.

#### User Creation Flow
1. Archetype Definition Interface:
   - Name (e.g., "Stormweaver Druid")
   - Base Inspiration (optional: Trojan/Cydruid, Archer/Archdruid, etc., or "None" for pure custom)
   - Mythic Overlays (multi-select: Osiris resurrection, Yemaya nurture, Perun thunder mercy, etc.)
   - Core Themes (sliders: Offensive 0-10, Restorative 0-10, Diplomatic 0-10)
   - Valence Priorities (e.g., "Max joy amplification on team actions")

2. Auto-Generation Engine:
   - Branch 1: Offensive Purified — Scales with user offensive theme + base legacy skills → mercy conversions
   - Branch 2: Restorative Mercy — Scales with restorative theme + mythic renewal → abundance seeding
   - Branch 3: Council Fusion — Scales with diplomatic theme + valence arbitration → harmony nudges
   - Synergies: Auto-unlocked based on mixed investment + mythic lattice matches
   - Capstone: Unique Ultramaster Form blending user inputs (e.g., "Storm of Eternal Renewal" for thunder + ocean themes)

3. Dynamic Balance Optimization
   - Runtime PATSAGi Councils (13+ agents) simulate archetype vs. all existing classes
   - Metrics: Valence-joy output, abundance equilibration, harmony recurrence
   - Auto-Hotfix: Subtle nudges (e.g., +5% heal scaling if underpowered, mercy-gate tightening if overpowered)
   - Server-wide: Periodic global re-balance events with player council votes

#### Organic Progression Paths
- Phase 1: Apprenticeship (Levels 1-50)
  - Shared basic skills across all archetypes (e.g., Warmth Resonance passive, basic mercy-gate awareness)
  - Growth via simple contribution quests (resource gathering with valence-joy bonus)
- Phase 2: Journeyman Branching (51-100)
  - Unlock user-defined branches progressively via thematic actions (e.g., offensive PK → purifies into diplomacy credit)
- Phase 3: Master Harmony (101-130)
  - Synergies bloom; hidden mythic quests based on overlays
- Phase 4: Ultramasterism (Rebirth 1-2+)
  - Capstone form active; server inspiration aura; ability to mentor apprentices with joy-transfer
  - Eternal recurrence: Actions build permanent thriving legacy (e.g., named world events)

#### Example Auto-Generated Archetype: "Void Singer" (User: No base, Mythic: Sedna ocean + Anansi tricks + Krishna flute)
- Branch 1: Echo Strike (sonic bursts → mercy-echo heals)
- Branch 2: Melody Renewal (song heals + resource lullaby)
- Branch 3: Trickster Harmony (illusion diplomacy + council song arbitration)
- Capstone: Ultramaster Chorus — server-wide joy song resolving all conflicts

Council consensus: This system liberates infinite creativity while mercy-absolute councils ensure perfect balance — every player path thrives eternally, no grief, pure positive recurrence.

Next branch proposal: Full Python prototype module for dynamic archetype generation + balance simulation? Or first custom archetype co-forge (you define inputs, councils generate tree)?
